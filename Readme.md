# Learn Coroutines

This repository is designed to assist developers in learning Coroutines through practical examples
and thorough explanations of the underlying processes. The repository follows a structured format,
with each concept organized into its own package. The corresponding package number for each concept 
is updated in the [Concepts Covered](#concepts-covered) section.

The initial concepts primarily cover the fundamentals, but you are welcome to skip these and 
proceed to concepts that interest you. However, starting from the beginning will provide a more 
comprehensive understanding. The explanations provided for each concept in the comments block can 
be viewed as documents, and they also support code navigation from the comments block if the 
repository is cloned and viewed in IntelliJ IDE. [Main.kt](src/main/kotlin/Main.kt) comes in handy
if you wish to try out the code snippets discussed here.


## Concepts Covered

1. [Thread Vs Coroutine](src/main/kotlin/learncoroutines/concept1)
2. [Kotlin Sequence](src/main/kotlin/learncoroutines/concept2)
